# üîç Problem 1: Find Most Frequent Element
# Given a list of integers, return the value that appears most frequently.
# If there's a tie, return any of the most frequent.

# Example:
# Input: [1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3]
# Output: 3

Time and Space Analysis for problem 1:
- Best-case: O(n)
- Worst-case: O(n^2)
- Average-case: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- Why this approach? Simple and straightforward using built-in methods.
- Could it be optimized? Yes, using a dictionary to count the times the number show up would reduce time complexity to O(n).

- Why does doubling reduce the cost overall? Because it reduces the frequency of resizing operations.
